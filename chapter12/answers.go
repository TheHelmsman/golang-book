/*
	1. Writing a good suite of tests is not always easy, but the process of writings 
	tests often reveals more about a problem then you may at first re- alize. 
	
	For example, with our Average function what happens if you pass in an empty 
	list ([]float64{})? How could we modify the function to return 0 in this case?

		see:
			`math/math.go`
			`math/math_test.go`

	2. Write a series of tests for the Min and Max functions you wrote in the previous chapter.
